Online Learning Coaching Website
Hello Connections, I am thrilled to announce that we have successfully completed our final project of my Full Stack Development Internship from Ardent Computech Technology. A massive thanks to my team mate Shreya Barnwal.

Languages used:-
📍HTML : HTML is used within JSP(JavaServer Page) to create the user interface.

📍CSS : CSS has been to style the login,home,register,dashboard page and enhance its visual appearance. Inline styling has been used to define style objects within the component and use them as inline styles for elements. This can help keep the styles organized.

📍Java: Java is the core programming language used for the backend development of our Online Learning Coaching Website. Java provides the robustness and flexibility needed to handle various functionalities such as user authentication, data processing, and handling server-side operations. We have implemented Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) to handle HTTP requests, manage sessions, and dynamically generate content for the users.

📍MySQL: As the preferred relational database management system, MySQL was chosen to store and manage user data, course information, and other essential details. Its reliability, speed, and scalability make it an ideal choice for our project.
